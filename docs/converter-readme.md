# OpenImages format annotations to Yolov3 format

- Put your dataset downloaded from openimages into folder named "OID"
- `python OID2YOLOv3.py`
- Wait for some time. Depending on the amount of images you have, the script will take time. IT took me apprx. 30 seconds to convert  600+ images under "Rocket" category from Open Images 4. 

## How to download OID dataset?
